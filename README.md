Code and data associated with the paper *The influence of explicit local dynamics on range expansions driven by long-range dispersal* [(Villiger and Paulose 2022)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.508171v1).

We ran simulations using `inv_transf_jumps.slim` and analyzed data using various Python scripts. The code used to generate figures for the paper is included in `figures.ipynb`, as are exact numbers of simulations that went into averages and notes about which Python scripts generated the data that went into each figure.

The SLiM simulations will always return at least two CSV files: a single-row file that records simulation parameters, and a longer file that records population-level data (population size, heterozygosity, etc.) each generation. Setting `record_spatial` to true leads to another CSV file with all individuals' spatial positions and birth generations. The outputs for measurements at the level of interaction regions (logistic growth and local heterozygosity) are structured as 2D arrays where each column is a different interaction region. The simulation data that went into figures in the paper is stored in the data folder, and Python scripts used to analyze simulation data are stored in the code folder.
